# QuantLab

**QuantLab** is a modular and extensible quantitative trading and market data platform built in **C#**.  
It provides a scalable foundation for real-time financial data processing, leveraging both **asynchronous programming** and **multithreading** to achieve high concurrency and low latency.

---

## 🚀 Overview

QuantLab is designed as a **high-performance trading research and data system** with a focus on flexibility, extensibility, and interoperability.  
The solution architecture is **modular**, allowing independent development and integration of new components without disrupting existing ones.

While currently implemented primarily in **C#**, QuantLab is evolving toward a **polyglot architecture** that may include **JavaScript**, **Python**, or other languages for scripting, analytics, and UI components.

## 🧩 Architecture

### Key Characteristics
- **Modular and Extensible Design** – Each component or module (e.g., Market Data Hub, Core Engine, Strategy Modules) is loosely coupled and easily replaceable or extendable.  
- **Concurrent Processing** – Uses a combination of **asynchronous programming (async/await)** and **multithreading** to maximize throughput and responsiveness.  
- **Cross-Communication Protocols** – Supports both **REST API** and **gRPC** for efficient service-to-service communication.  
- **Test-Driven Development** – Backed by a comprehensive **NUnit** test suite employing **Moq** for mocking and **FluentAssertions** for expressive test assertions.  

### Core Projects

#### 💹 QuantLab.MarketData.Hub
An **ASP.NET Core** service that exposes:
- **REST API endpoints** for external HTTP clients.
- **gRPC services(using Protocol Buffers)** for internal high-performance communication.

This hub manages market data ingestion, normalization, and distribution.

#### 🧪 QuantLab.Tests
The unit testing project uses:
- **NUnit** – for structuring and executing tests.  
- **Moq** – for mocking dependencies.  
- **FluentAssertions** – for clean, human-readable assertions.

Unit test methods follow **MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior** naming convention, and the **AAA (Arrange–Act–Assert)** pattern for clarity and consistency.

## ⚙️ Concurrency Model

QuantLab uses a **hybrid concurrency approach**:
- **Asynchronous I/O** for network-bound operations (data feeds, APIs).
- **Multithreading** for CPU-intensive computations and event handling.
- **async/await** patterns for fine-grained control and scalability.

## 🆕 Latest Major C# Features Used

QuantLab leverages modern C# language capabilities for robustness and developer productivity.  
Key features (depending on the project’s target framework) include:

- **Records** for immutable data models  
- **Pattern Matching Enhancements** (e.g., `switch` expressions)  
- **Nullable Reference Types** for better null safety  
- **Target-Typed `new` Expressions**  
- **Init-Only Setters** for immutable object initialization  
- **File-Scoped Namespaces** for cleaner syntax  
- **Improved Interpolated Strings** and collection initializers
- **etc.**

## 🌐 Communication Interfaces

### REST API
- Lightweight, standard HTTP-based endpoints for integration with external systems.

### gRPC
- High-performance, strongly typed communication using Protocol Buffers between internal microservices.

Both interfaces are built on **ASP.NET Core**, enabling cross-platform deployment and high scalability.
